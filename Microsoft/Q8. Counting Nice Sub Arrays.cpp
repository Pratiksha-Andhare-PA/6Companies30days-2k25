# Approaches:

1. Brute Force Approach:

This approach iterates through all possible subarrays and counts the odd numbers in each subarray. 
If the count of odd numbers equals ùëò, the subarray is considered nice.

Time Complexity: O(n^2 ) due to iterating over all subarrays.
Space Complexity: O(1), as no additional data structures are used.

2. Optimal Approach:

This approach uses the sliding window technique with prefix sums. 
By maintaining a running count of odd numbers and using a hash map to track previous occurrences of specific odd counts, 
we can efficiently count the nice subarrays.

Time Complexity: O(n), as the array is processed in a single pass.
Space Complexity: O(n) due to the hash map storing the frequency of odd counts.
