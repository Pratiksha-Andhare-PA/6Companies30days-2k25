/**

# Sliding Window Approach:
This approach uses a sliding window of size 10.

Sliding Window: Traverse the string with a sliding window of length 10, and extract each 10-character-long substring.

Hashing: Use two hash sets:
1. seen: Tracks substrings that have been encountered.
2. ans: Stores repeated substrings that appear more than once.

For each substring:
If it has been seen before, add it to the ans set.
Otherwise, add it to the seen set.

Convert the result set ans to a vector and return it.
Time Complexity: O(n), where ùëõ is the length of the string,
because we only scan the string once and perform constant-time operations with hash sets.

Space Complexity: O(n), due to the storage of substrings in hash sets.
