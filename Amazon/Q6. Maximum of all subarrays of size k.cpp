/**

# Approaches:

1. Brute Force Approach:

Iterate through all possible subarrays of size ùëò, 
calculate the maximum for each subarray, and store the results.

Time Complexity: O(n‚ãÖk), where ùëõ is the size of the array.
Space Complexity: O(1), as no extra data structures are used (excluding the result vector).

Inefficient for large arrays due to nested loops.

2. Optimal Approach (Using Deque):

Use a deque to maintain indices of useful elements for each window, 
ensuring maximum is always at the front. 
Slide the window while updating the deque efficiently.

Time Complexity: O(n), as each element is processed at most twice (added and removed from the deque).
Space Complexity: O(k), for the deque to store indices.
